# DSBodySizeRandomizer

Livesplit plugin for Dark Souls that randomly changes the sizes of your character's body parts, adds a colour fade effect to your hair, and changes your character's body colour (only takes effect after a quit out). Also includes IGT plugin.

Each effect can be enabled or disabled individually by opening the file in a text editor and changing the variables in the section marked "USER CONFIGURABLE SECTION" from true to false. Additionally you can alter the change rate (lower = more often) and change amount, as well as maximum and minimum body sizes in the same section.

Load as a Livesplit auto splitter in your layout. May require disabling the IGT plugin under Edit Splits.

Thanks to B3LYP and AndrovT for the combined body color changer plus IGT plugin, which this is built on, and is included.
